                    <p class="two-thirds-paragraph"> We conducted 26 contextual inquiries with users representing different levels of expertise in Renaissance software, different educational roles, and different state requirements. The contextual inquiries directly informed the product we developed, as findings from these interviews were synthesized to generate insights.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Classroom Teachers.</strong> Classroom teachers often set goals for their students, either based on administrative expectations or as a means of motivating students in their classrooms. Their goal-setting practices are informative for how teachers view student goals in their classrooms.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Intervention & Instructional Support Teachers.</strong> Intervention teachers are the primary users of the goal-setting wizard. Intervention teachers work with the the higher tiers of support for students in MTSS systems. Goal-setting is both a requirement and an imperative part of understanding whether their students are showing adequate growth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Administrators.</strong> Administrators play an important role in setting organizational practices. They are often responsible for implementing decision rules for allocation of MTSS resources, and are a key part of setting data practices for teachers in their schools.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To support and supplement the findings from the interviews, the team completed literature review in the areas of goal-setting (regarding motivation, measurement for instructional efficacy, and alignment of instruction) and growth measurements (regarding mindsets and psychometric methods). Competitive analysis of benchmarking products was competed to realize approaches that competitors have taken in meeting user needs.

                    <p class="two-thirds-paragraph">Vittore used several human-centered research methods to analyze our data.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Affinity diagramming</strong> involves grouping raw data into summative, hierarchical thematic and insight categories. This is a bottom-up process in which thematic and insight categories emerged organically as we sifted through our interview notes. Our team also used a theoretical framework informed by Ambrose et al. (2010) and Wiggins and McTighe (2005). This framework allowed us to consider how categories fit into categories of instructional design including educational goals, instruction, and assessment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Building models</strong> allowed us to organize our interview findings in various ways in order to uncover user behavior patterns. Vittore used three types of models to understand users: cultural models, information flow models, and sequence flow models. The cultural model helps us understand the value points, expectations, and influences between all stakeholders, including administrators, teachers, and students. The information flow model similarly helps us visualize what types of information are being conveyed between stakeholders. Sequence flow models were used to take a detailed view at the workflow of an intervention specialists, noting the work processes and interactions between roles and tools. This model is particularly illustrative compared to the best-practice sequence flow model provided by Renaissance administrators, teachers, and students. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Generating insights</strong> is the process of identifying behavior patterns, breakdowns, and pain points. Based on the affinity diagrams and the models resulting from the previous step, we determined breakdowns and synthesized findings. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Personas</strong> are models of users who we interviewed in our research (Cooper, 1995). Personas are compiled from the behaviors, motivations, and needs of the many users whom we interviewed. Personas serve to inform the product design. By assembling and concretizing user patterns into particular personas, the team has a precise way to measure and communicate how well a design concept meets the needs of a concrete type of user. Personas were key in the development process, as learning gains and user experience were grouped into the responses from different users.

                    <p class="two-thirds-paragraph">The findings from our user interviews were synthesized using modeling so we could consider how information flows between different users, the cultural expectations of stakeholders, and the workflows of the users in the MTSS process. These models were used to map out the interactions we discovered in the contextual inquiry process, to note breakdowns, and to generate insights about ways to improve teacher practices.

                    <p class="two-thirds-paragraph"> Insights from the user interviews were generated through affinity diagramming and model-building, and fit into various phases of the MTSS intervention cycle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Based on these insights, the team generated product concepts that would help address teacher needs. These product concepts were refined in a visioning session with Renaissance, and combined to focus on several key insights. Based on the visioning session, the following insights were addressed in the final product:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Goals reflect desired - not expected - performance.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <i>“The goal we set if because that’s where we truly want them, we want them to be at the 60th percentile.” - Middle School Administrator</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Goals for students often come from a performance-driven, top-down approach as a response to predictions on state standards. Because schools are expected to have a certain percentage of their students pass state standardized assessments, student goals are set to achieve these outcomes. However, these goals are not likely to be attainable for students in Tier 2 or 3 support. Intervention teachers, aware of this limitation, are often forced to track a student’s “realistic” goal in addition to the numeric goal that is set in the system. Because the goals are not realistic from the start, the schools do not have a good measurement to determine whether their interventions are as useful as they expect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Teachers want growth, but they don’t use a reference metric against which to compare student test scores.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <i>“I tell the students ‘any improvement and you’re not failing.’” - Elementary school ELA teacher</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Due to the difficulty of achieving the desired goal of “closing the gap” for students in Tier 2 or 3 support, educators, particularly intervention specialists, are most interested in their students demonstrating growth through the intervention process. Most teachers considered any growth an indication of an effective intervention without comparing that growth to what is expected of other students of equivalent performance levels. Because of this, the growth might demonstrate that a student is learning, but there are no indications about whether that learning is happening at an expected rate. This has the potential to sustain and even increase performance gaps between students. Even if a student in high support environment is growing, this growth might be too slow to catch them up to their classmates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Limitations to using Student Growth Percentile (SGP) include distrust in the validity of the metric, difficulty in understanding the measurement logic, and perceived mismatch between SGP, desired goals, and realistic goals.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <i>“Average growth for a student is between 35 SGP and 65 SGP. That’s nuts, that’s just too big.” - Middle School Administrator</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Teachers question the validity of the SGP measurement because it compares student performance between only the current test and the previous test. Teachers feel that a particularly strong or poor testing day could significantly impact the norm-referenced group against which the student is compared.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More pressingly, many teachers do not understand what SGP represents. Although they know it is intended to measure growth, few users understand how to interpret its calculated value for setting an attainable goal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, setting goals through SGP does not allow the possibility of meeting the desired goals. If a student is very low performing (e.g. 2nd percentile), the SGP required to have that student reach the state benchmark is much too high to be reasonable for that student. SGP may paint a bleak picture - that even if a student is growing, they are not likely to advance.
