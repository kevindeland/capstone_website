                    <p class="about-paragraph"> <strong><font color="C23C53">KEVIN DELAND</font> | DEVELOPMENT</strong> brings a diverse technical background to the Vittore team with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Duke University and four years of experience as a Software Engineer at IBM. One of Kevinâ€™s driving motivations is to improve STEM education, because he believes sharing with youth the magic of how the world works can enable them to create new ideas and inventions. Kevin also has an artistic flair and loves dancing, writing, and the occasional bursts into improvised rap.
